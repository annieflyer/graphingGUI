Welcome to the wonderland of Gnome!
I am a Goblin, and I am the head Gnome technician in this country.
Do you want me to tell you more about this country?

The country has already had a long history.
Maybe over a thousand years.
Gnomeregan was the capital city of the country until a fierce invasion by our rivalries led to its tragic downfall.
In a desperate attempt to kill the rivalries, our ruler led country win the victory finally.(Click OK to continue)
However, we suffered a lot. 

Please rebuild this city with me. I would be very glad to see a human rising to be a top technician!
Come! We have lots of things to do!!!
(Do you want any instructions?)

OK,here is how our city is going to be rebuilt, first, you can see that there are quite a few buttons on the right.
The first button is adding a village, if you click on it,
:
you will be asked to enter the X and Y coordinates of the new village
:
and then you will be asked to name the village using a unique id
:
then click ok to finish
;
Next,we can add a road between two villages using the "Add Road" button
:
You should choose a starting village and an end village
:
You should also add the cost/weight of the road
:
Notice that the length does not match the actual length between villages in the panel
BUT THAT is because our new cartographer is REALLY BAD at geometrics;
;
Also, you can invite Gnomes around the world to join this city!
Click on the "Add a Gnome" Button to invite a friendly Gnome
:
Of course, make sure you give him his new home adress!
:
And his new Gnomish name!
;
You can guide our friendly friends around for a quick tour!
Click on" Choose a destination" and click on a Gnome
:
And this friend will politely asks you to hang out with him!
:
Be friendly and answer YES! Otherwise our friends will wonder lazily around the city, not knowing what's to see
:
choose a destination for this wonderful trip
;

To find your friend around,click on the "Search "button
:
and enter the name of your friend!

There are other buttons for you to be explored have fun and enjoy it!!!!
